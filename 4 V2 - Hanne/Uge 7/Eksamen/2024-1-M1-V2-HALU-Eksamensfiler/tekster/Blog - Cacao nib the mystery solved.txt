
Cacao nib - the mystery solved

"You can't get up from the table until you finish your cacao nibs." Well, maybe not quite.

A cacao nib is the shelled and roasted cacao bean that has a crunchy texture and boasts that yummy chocolate flavor that is so universally loved. Think of it, perhaps, as premature chocolate, or as a veritable putty to be formed into anything from bland, cheap and watered-down, mass-produced candy to a dark, intense and ultra-rich confection. The difference? It's how far that little cacao nib is diluted with other ingredients, whatever they may be.

So percentage, friend, it's all about percentage. Check your chocolate for it's percentage of cacao and you will find out not only how rich and dark it's flavor will be, but also how beneficial it will be to your health, according to the current school of thought. And as with so many things in life: the more, the better.
