Welcome to Xocolatl

To create colorful and tasteful chocolate has always been our passion. We respect the raw materials, the craft, and the tradition of chocolate making but we are also not afraid to experiment with taste, color, and shape - without ever compromising the quality.

Our chocolate is hand crafted in our chocolate workshop in beautiful Christiansfeld - a town of many traditions.

All our products are made from 100% sustainable and organic cocoa as controlled by Cocoa Horizons (link til: https://www.cocoahorizons.org/)
